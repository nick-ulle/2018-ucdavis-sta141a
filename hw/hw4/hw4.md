Due __November 6 at 10:30am__.

Assemble your answers into a report. Please do not include any raw R output.
Instead, present your results as neatly formatted tables or graphics, and write
something about each one. You must __cite your sources__. Your report should be
__no more than 10 pages__ including graphics, but excluding code and citations.
Think carefully about what information is important to include. 

When you are finished, submit a digital copy on Canvas. The digital copy must
contain:

* Your report as a PDF file, with your code in the appendix.
* Your code as 1 or more R scripts.

Your submission will be graded according to the STA 141A grading standards,
which are available on Canvas.

## Description

In this assignment, you will continue to examine the Craigslist data set to:

* Study the spatial characteristics of the rental market.
* Combine with demographic data from the US Census Bureau to make
  further inferences.

The US Census Bureau provides a variety of data sets (including spatial data
sets) online. As a starting point for Question 3 in this assignment, a zip file
with demographic data for California places is available on Canvas. The data
set in the zip file is from the 2010 US Census, and has place names that
approximately match those in the Craigslist data set.

Ask questions on Piazza and in office hours to get help with merging the data.


## Questions

1. Use maps to explore at least 3 features of the Craigslist posts in Davis. In
   other words, come up with some meaningful questions, answer them, and then
   discuss your findings (and limitations). You may use other kinds of
   statistics and graphics _for support_.

2. Repeat question 1 for the southern half of the San Francisco Bay Area
   (counties San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, and Contra Costa).
   Can you make stronger conclusions about the San Francisco Bay Area than you
   could about Davis? Why or why not? Explain.

3.  Choose one question to answer using the US 2010 Census data together with
    the Craigslist data:

      * Which places in the southern San Francisco Bay Area have the oldest
        populations? How does this relate to the rental market, if at all?

      * Which major cities in California are the most diverse? How does this
        relate to the rental market, if at all?

    Make sure to say which question you chose to answer.


## Additional Data Sets

If you want, you can find additional data sets from the Census Bureau on the
American Fact Finder website:

<https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml>

The "American Community Survey" and the "Decennial Census" are the most likely
sources of useful information.

You can find shapefiles from the Census Bureau at:

<https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html>

Using shapefiles is **not required** for this assignment, but they may be
useful for adding detail to your maps or for matching additional census data to
Craigslist posts.
