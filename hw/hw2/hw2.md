Due __October 16 at 10:30am__.

In this assignment, you'll continue to analyze the U.S.\ Department of
Education's College Scorecard data set from Assignment 1. The data set and
documentation are available on Canvas.

1. Are there any features with no missing values? Which features have the most
   missing values? Explore the missing values and report any patterns you find.

2. Explore student populations for the universities. Are there any schools with
   unusual populations? What is the relationship between undergraduate and
   graduate populations? Are there exceptions to the relationship?

3. Explore the program percentages for the universities. What programs are the
   most popular? What programs are the least popular? Are there any program
   percentages that show patterns different from the others?

4. How does tuition vary across different states? Is there a relationship
   between the number of universities in a state and tuition? Do these
   characteristics differ for in-state tuition and out-of-state tuition?

5. Which colleges have the most diverse demographics? Make sure to explain how
   you measured "diversity" for this problem, in addition to discussing your
   conclusions.

6. Answer 2 of the questions you invented for Assignment 1, Problem 12. Use
   statistical summaries (including graphics) as evidence to support your
   conclusions. Also make sure to clearly state each question before your
   answer!

7. Reflect on the questions you answered in Problem 6. Did they lead to
   interesting conclusions? Why or why not? Did they raise new questions? Is it
   the question that makes a result interesting, the data, or both? Explain.

8. List and answer 2 follow-up questions raised by any of the work you did for
   this assignment. Along with each question and answer, make sure to explain
   what raised the question for you.

Assemble your answers into a report. Please do not include any raw R output.
Instead, present your results as neatly formatted tables or graphics, and write
something about each one. You must __cite your sources__. Your report should be
__no more than 10 pages__ including graphics, but excluding code and citations.
Think carefully about what information is important to include.

When you are finished, submit:

* A digital copy on Canvas. The digital copy must contain your report (1 PDF)
  and your code (1 or more R scripts).

* A printed copy in lecture. The printed copy must contain your report and your
  code (in an appendix). Please print double-sided to save trees.

Your submission will be graded according to the STA 141A grading standards,
which are available on Canvas.
