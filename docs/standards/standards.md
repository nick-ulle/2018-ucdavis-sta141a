Your work will be graded across multiple standards. For each standard, there
are 5 possible marks:

Mark | Description                                           | Approximate Grade
---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -----------------
`++` | Exceeds the standard.                                 | A+
`+`  | Meets the standard.                                   | B to A
`-`  | Needs improvement.                                    | C to B
`--` | Needs serious improvement, but shows credible effort. | D to C
`0`  | No credit.                                            | F

We'll also give you written feedback about how to improve your work. If you are
ever unsure about any of the standards, please ask!

The standards may be updated throughout the quarter. Any updates will be
announced on Piazza.

## Core Standards

These standards apply to all assignments.

R1 -- Report Clarity
:   Your report is legible, logical, and makes conclusions that are supported
by evidence in the data.

R2 -- Report Skepticism
:   Your report is reflective and skeptical. Your report points out assumptions
and examines how credible they are. Your report discusses limitations of
results and interprets data from multiple perspectives.


F1 -- Figure Clarity
:   Your figures can be read without extensive knowledge of the data set.
Figures have titles, labels, units, legends, and other aids to the reader.

F2 -- Figure Selection
:   Your figures are appropriate for the data they present, visually clear,
convey important information, and are not redundant.


C1 -- Code Clarity
:   Your code is legible and clear. There are spaces around operators, lines
don’t start with “>”, variable names are descriptive, and there is a consistent
style.

C2 -- Code Organization
:   Your code is organized into "paragraphs" of logically related operations.
Your code has brief comments to explain the purpose of each paragraph.


## Additional Standards

For later assignments, we may also use these standards. Assignments will
specify when any of these apply.

R3 -- Report Narrative
:   Your report interprets what each result and each figure means as part of a
“big picture” narrative.

C3 -- Code Modularity
:   Your code consists of small functions that each complete a meaningful step
(this is important) in the larger task.

C4 -- Code Efficiency
:   Your code does not contain the efficiency pitfalls discussed in class and
uses programming abstractions (functions, loops, etc) to avoid redundant code.
