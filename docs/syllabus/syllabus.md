\maketitle

This class is about communication and computational reasoning. The goal is to
provide you with skills necessary to modern statisticians and data scientists.
The major themes of the class are:

* Creating graphics to gain insights from data.
* Writing about and interpreting results.
* Reasoning about problems that are open-ended or do not have a clear-cut
  solution.
* Computing with the R programming language.

# Topics

For the first half of the quarter, we'll focus on techniques to explore and
summarize data. In the second half of the quarter, we'll move on to cleaning
messy data sets and implementing statistical algorithms.

# Waitlist

This class has a long waitlist. If you decide you don't want to take the class,
please drop immediately to make room for others. Note: the drop deadline is October 9th.

The Statistics Department PTA policy is at
[statistics.ucdavis.edu/courses/pta-policy][pta]. If you have any questions
adding or dropping, contact Kim McMullen (stat-advising@ucdavis.edu).

We will only use email for private matters (grading, emergencies, etc.). Please
__do not__ email us about class material -- post on Piazza instead.

Office hours are posted on Piazza.


# Piazza

Piazza ([www.piazza.com][piazza]) is the class' online forum. You should have
already received an email inviting you to Piazza. If you did not, or have any
problems accessing Piazza, please email me or a TA as soon as possible. Note:
the Piazza access code is `"sta141a"`.

[piazza]: https://www.piazza.com

**Post your questions about class material on Piazza**. Anyone in the class can
answer your question, so you're likely to get an answer quickly. When you use
Piazza:

*   Be polite and respectful to others.

*   Search before you post. Your question may have already been asked and
    answered.

*   When you post a question, explain the context and give an example of what
    you mean.

All announcements will be posted on Piazza. Assignments and files will be
posted on Canvas.


# Grade Breakdown

Participation (15%)
:   Participate in lecture, discussion, office hours, and Piazza. Asking
    questions is the best way to get help. Answering questions is a great way
    to verify that you understand the material.

Assignments (85%)
:   There will be 2 short assignments followed by 4 long assignments.

    We will grade assignments against a rubric that measures the quality of
    your writing, graphics, and code. The rubric will be posted before or with
    the first assignment.

    No assignment grades will be dropped. If you can't turn in an assignment on
    time and have a legitimate excuse (such as medical emergency), we can
    arrange an extension or alternative.

# Assignment Guidelines

*   Write your solutions in report format, as if you are a professional data
    scientist or data journalist. In your writing, focus on conjectures and
    discoveries about the data rather than on programming details. 

*   Include all of your code in an appendix (at the end of your report). We
    will read and grade your code. Use a consistent style, and organize your
    code with comments and white space. There are many style guides online for
    R code.
    
*   The goal of data science is to understand and gain new insights from data.
    Sometimes the best way to do this is to use a statistical model. However,
    do not use arbitrary models just to make your results seem more
    "statistical".

# Academic Honesty

Even professional programmers talk to their coworkers and use references to
help solve programming problems. So I encourage you to:

* Discuss the problems with your classmates.

* Search for references online and in books.

* Adapt short pieces of code ($\leq 10$ lines) you find on Piazza or online.
  When you do this, you must __cite the source__. For Piazza, cite the post
  number. For other sources, cite the title, author, and URL.

That said, __all writing and graphics must be your own work. A large majority
of your code must be your own work.__ If you're unsure whether something is
okay, please
ask!
